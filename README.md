# SupervisedTwitterBot
This is a bot written in Python, using the tweepy and twitter APIs. It has a user-interface and a clean runtime to automate Twitter activity.

# Why
I noticed Twitter has some intense rate-limiting and lately it has
taken bits of innovation to get around this for the general sake of
automating a low-frequency bot.

I looked for a bot, thinking perhaps making one from scratch is unneeded.
As Twitter changes their API, other bots have as a result broken so I
will make an attempt to keep up and update this repository so that the
average person can enjoy the Twitter bot and change its functionality
without worrying about the goal at hand which is to leave it alone and have it do what is expected.

# Use
Use this how you want. Editing intervals may break something or get you rate-limited. 

# Copyright
I don't own any API or data this mines and uses.
