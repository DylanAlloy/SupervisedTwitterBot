# SupervisedTwitterBot

This is a bot written in Python, using the tweepy and twitter APIs. It has a user-interface and a clean runtime to automate Twitter activity.

# Why
I noticed Twitter has some intense rate-limiting and lately it has
taken bits of innovation to get around this for the general sake of
automating a low-frequency bot.

I looked for a bot, thinking perhaps making one from scratch is unneeded.
As Twitter changes their API, other bots have as a result broken so I
will make an attempt to keep up and update this repository so that the
average person can enjoy the Twitter bot and change its functionality
without worrying about the goal at hand which is to leave it alone and have it do what is expected.

# Use

The runtime photo above is just to show what the commercial version would look like. I'm making one with a authentication system to verify that the user has paid for the software linking to a server I own on GoDaddy. The project file will show this over time as I add SQL connection. A paid version will be released eventually.

It will prompt you for necessary information such your screen name but you will need to enter your API and access tokens manually into programdirectory/"OAUTH.txt". These variables are 
vital for functionality. Have them ready.
Use this how you want. Editing intervals may break something or get you rate-limited.

I don't own any API or data this mines and uses.
